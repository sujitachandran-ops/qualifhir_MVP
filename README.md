# qualifhir_MVP
QualiFHIR is an AI-powered enhancement to our existing data processing pipeline that intelligently analyzes, validates, and standardizes clinical data — including identifying and correcting missing or inaccurate clinical data before they are consumed & distributed to downstream applications. This ensures high-quality, interoperable, and reliable data for all downstream applications / consumers.
- Uses LLMs + context-aware algorithms to detect and fix errors
- Automatically corrects wrong/missing clinical data
- Understands semantic meaning of each instance (Observation – Lab data, Procedure – CPT codes, etc) to infer the right mapping
- Provides explainable corrections with a confidence score for every adjustment
- Ensures all data entering the ecosystem is accurate, interoperable, and FHIR-compliant
- Converts raw, fragmented inputs into clean, trustworthy, analytics-ready data for downstream apps
